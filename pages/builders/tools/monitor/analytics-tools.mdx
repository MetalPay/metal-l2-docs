# Analytics tools

The following guide lists platforms you can use to gather analytics and setup customizations about Metal L2.

## Blocknative

[Blocknative](https://www.blocknative.com/) lets you [decode](http://docs.blocknative.com/ethernow/batch-decoder-api) and [analyze](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/blob-archive) OP Stack Batches submitted to the Ethereum L1. You can inspect, analyze, decode, and download the data of any batch – confirmed on-chain or not – via public APIs or visually through the [Ethernow Explorer](http://ethernow.xyz). Below you can find links to the different resources:

*   [Batch Decoding API](http://docs.blocknative.com/ethernow/batch-decoder-api): decode OP Stack Batch transactions into its human-readable, JSON format.
*   [Blob Archive API](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/blob-archive): take any versioned hash of an OP Stack Blob and receive the blob data (even beyond the 4096 epoch window of storage).
*   [Mempool Archive](https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-data-archive/mempool-archive): Analyze any OP Stack transaction that was in the Ethereum mempool to see detection time, time pending, gas, etc.
*   [Ethernow explorer](http://ethernow.xyz): Visually see transactions and batches enter the mempool and get organized into blocks. Use this filter to see OP Stack Batches enter the mempool and land on-chain.

## thirdweb

[thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/metal-l2?utm_source=metal\&utm_medium=docs) insight is a powerful indexer for onchain data compatible with any EVM, letting you index, query and transform blockchain data.
With insight you get:
* Raw blockchain transaction & events APIs to get any data quickly & reliably
* Custom API schemas (”blueprints”) for flexible data pipelining
* Shareable blueprints for fast transactions

Start building with [thirdweb Insight](https://portal.thirdweb.com/insight?utm_source=metal\&utm_medium=docs)

thirdweb Insight can be used to:
* Fetch all assets & metadata (ERC20, ERC721, ERC115) for a given wallet address.
* Fetch all sales of skins on your in-game marketplace
* Fetch daily active wallets for your application or game
And so much more

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) monitoring stack lets you [inspect any transaction execution on Metal L2 or Metal L2 Testnet](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger#how-to-use-tenderly-debugger).

You can inspect the state of your verified contract in any step of the transaction's execution, as well as step into or over function calls.
The level of detail the Tenderly dashboard presents will reduce your development time as well as help you understand the execution flow of transactions.
It helps you to inspect states at every instance of transaction and gives a platform to trace transactions. You can also simulate pending (or any other historical) transactions and see their exact outcomes.

*   [setup real-time alerts for smart contracts](https://blog.tenderly.co/how-to-set-up-real-time-alerting-for-smart-contracts-with-tenderly/)
*   [automate your responses to alert triggers](https://blog.tenderly.co/tenderly-alert-webhooks/) with custom webhooks

## Dune analytics

[Dune Analytics](https://dune.com) allows anyone to create dashboards that present information about OP Chains (Metal L2, Base, and Zora are available). See [Dune Docs](https://dune.com/docs/) for more info.
You can find a list of community created dashboards for OP Chains [here](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards?q=tags%3Aop%2Coptimism%2Csuperchain\&order=trending\&time_range=24h), or [create your own](https://docs.dune.com/#queries) dashboard.

Here are some of our favorite dashboards so far:

*   [OP Chains / Superchain - L2 Activity, Chain Economics](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/op-stack-chains-l1-activity)
*   [OP Chains / Superchain - Popular Apps & Project Usage Trends](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/superchain-op-chains-apps-and-project-usage-trends)
*   [By OP Chain - L2/L1 Chain Economics](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/optimism-l2-l1-economics)
*   [OP Token House Delegates](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house)
*   [Superchain NFTs](https://dune.com/oplabspbc/superchain-nfts)
