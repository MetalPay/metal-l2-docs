# Account abstraction

[ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/docs/paymasters/introduction), also known as Account Abstraction, enables more opportunities for apps and wallet developers to innovate on user experiences, including the ability to:

*   Batch transactions together (e.g. approve and execute a swap in one go)
*   Offer wallets with easy recovery and no seed phrase
*   Sponsor the gas fees for transactions
*   Enable users to pay gas in the token(s) of their choice

## Providers

*   [Biconomy](https://docs.biconomy.io/): is an Account Abstraction toolkit that enables you to provide the simplest UX for your app or wallet. It offers modular smart accounts, as well as paymasters and bundlers as a service for sponsoring gas and executing transactions at scale. See this [tutorial](/chain/biconomy) for trying Biconomy on the Metal L2 Testnet.
*   [thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/connect/account-abstraction/overview?utm_source=metal\&utm_medium=docs) offers a complete platform to leverage account abstraction.
    Remove the clunky user experience of requiring gas & signatures for every onchain action.
    * Abstract away gas
    * Pre-audited account factory contracts
    * Built-in infra
